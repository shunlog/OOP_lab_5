### Popularity over time
One question we might ask is 
> How does the system evolve given some particular initial parameters?

Specifically, we can look at how the number of customers changes over time,
and compare different situations:
- it's a new restaurant and only a handful of people know about it
- the restaurant recently got lots of recognition due to a very successful ad

So, given these initial conditions

``` python
DAYS=50
COOKS_COUNT=5
WAITERS_COUNT=1
TABLES_COUNT=20
COOK_SALARY=80.0
```

Let's see how the model reacts to different values for `INITIAL_POPULARITY`.

For `INITIAL_POPULARITY=10`:

For `INITIAL_POPULARITY=5000`:
![](./img/too_popular.png)

We can see that in every case, the system stabilizes pretty fast at the same popularity of about `180` and oscillates between `160` and `200`.

Of course, if we set `INITIAL_POPULARITY=180` right away, then the system doesn't evolve at all:

### Optimal number of cooks
Another interesting question we might ask, is 
> What is the optimal number of cooks given a number of tables?

Of course, optimal in this case means maximizing profits.

So, let's see what's the optimal number of cooks for a small restaurant with 10 tables,
that has these initial conditions:

``` python
DAYS=50
MIN_COOKS=27
MAX_COOKS=35
COOKS_INTERVAL=1
WAITERS_COUNT=1
TABLES_COUNT=10
INITIAL_POPULARITY=180
COOK_SALARY=80.0
```

It's clear that the optimal number of cooks in this case is **3**.

What about 100 tables?
After a bit of trial and error, I arrived at this graph:

It's not very clear, but if we zoom in, we see that the optimal number of cooks is about 31-33.

Therefore we can extrapolate that our system turned out pretty linear,
requiring â‰ˆ3.2 cooks for every 10 tables,
which is not very interesting.

## Simulation
Here is an excerpt of the logs of a simulation run:
``` text
>>> Day 2 -- 18:25: Customer 860 entered restaurant.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:30: Customer 860 decided what to order.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:31: Waiter 240 took Customer 860's order.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:32: Waiter 240 left 1 orders in the order holder.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:32: Cook 260 started cooking Order 880.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:55: Cook 260 finished cooking Order 880.
>>> Day 2 -- 18:56: Waiter 240 served order to Customer 860.
>>> Day 2 -- 19:00: Starting closing. Customers can't enter anymore.
>>> Day 2 -- 19:26: Customer 860 finished eating and asked for the check.
>>> Day 2 -- 19:27: Waiter 240 billed Customer 860.
>>> Day 2 -- 19:27: Waiter 240 started cleaning the table.
>>> Day 2 -- 19:32: Waiter 240 finished cleaning the table.
